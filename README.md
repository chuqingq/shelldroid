#### 新增
* virtual env name 作为数字，自增；并作为IMEI和ANDROID_ID变化的部分
* 去掉phone model和phone brand
* 去掉IMEI和ANDROID_ID，virtual env name作为变化的部分，不变的部分使用真实的参数

#### 展示env列表
* 需要先确定：能否通过python uiautomator来方便的启动某个env：d(resourceId='im.xun.shelldroid:id/rv').scroll.to(text='wx2') 能找到，返回True
* 直接在env列表中展示active的项

### What is ShellDroid

ShellDroid is an Android App that help you to manage multi account of any App on the same devices. For example, you can use it to switch WeChat or Whatsapp account without reenter your username and password.

The mechanism behind ShellDroid is very simple: Every App on Android has a data folder, when you use that App( login or change some setting) all those information are saved in that folder, ShellDroid manage App's account by manage App's application data. which is simply backup and restore data folder. And that's why it need root privilege.

Some Apps(like Wechat) will try to bind your account with your devices. Those Apps usually use your device's IMEI,phone number, or phone model to identify you. Thanks to [Xposed](http://repo.xposed.info/), ShellDroid can fake those information to make a "portable" application data.

To demonstrate that, I create an [App](https://github.com/wuhx/phoneinfo) which simply call some Android API to identify your devices.  If run it directly, It will display your devices's IMEI, phone model, phone brand etc.(assume  you are not using any other privacy protection Apps of cause)

But if run it from ShellDroid, those information will be replaced by your Virtual Environment settings.

Basically it's a simplified [XPrivacy](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy) which not only restrict privacy information access by per App's setting, but also base on the account in that App.  Which means different Account of the same App can have different privacy restriction.

This App is not very complete, but the idea is well proved.

Any issues, fork, pull requests will be welcome.
